# Application Project

## Overview

Building an end-to-end application on a self-managed server is the best way to prepare for our programme. The foundation project is a simplified version of the projects you will build every week during the programme, so it's an excellent way for you to learn and prepare and for us to assess whether you're ready for our residency. To complete this exercise, you need to build, containerize, and deploy an MNIST digit classifier.

## Project Brief

### Goal

Build, containerize, and deploy a simple digit-recogniser trained on the MNIST dataset.

### Phases

1. Train a PyTorch Model
   - Develop a basic PyTorch model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
   - Train it locally and confirm that it achieves a reasonable accuracy.
2. Interactive Front-End
   - Create a web interface (using Streamlit) where users can draw a digit on a canvas or input area.
   - When the user submits the drawing, the web app should run the trained PyTorch model to produce:
     - Prediction: the model's guess at the digit (0â€“9).
     - Confidence: the model's probability for its prediction.
     - True Label: allow the user to manually input the correct digit so you can gather feedback.
3. Logging with PostgreSQL
   - Every time a prediction is made, log these details to a PostgreSQL database:
     - Timestamp
     - Predicted digit
     - User-provided true label
4. Containerization with Docker
   - Use Docker to containerize:
     - The PyTorch model/service
     - The Streamlit web app
     - The PostgreSQL database
   - Use Docker Compose to define your multi-container setup in a docker-compose.yml file.
5. Deployment
   - Set up a self-managed server (e.g., Hetzner's basic instance) or any other environment where you can install Docker and control the deployment end-to-end.
   - Deploy your containerized application to the server and make it accessible via a public IP or domain.
6. Add project to GitHub
   - Add your project to GitHub.
   - Make sure to include a README with a link to the live application.
   - Share the link to your GitHub repository with us via the application form.
